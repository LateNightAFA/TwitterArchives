Like in Vancouver. Go to Crystal Palace and try paying with a card - the 100+ venues don’t even take debit. Cash only, &amp; their 14 yo kid is working.

It’s part of her politics.   The hijab is 100% political and 0% religious. It’s a sign of The Muslim Brotherhood, nothing more. It’s never mentioned in the Quran, it’s not a religious requirement.  https://t.co/WcNa780xPE <!--1064328887302205440-->
